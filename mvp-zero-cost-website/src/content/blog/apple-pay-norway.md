Norway is a leader in digital payments, with widespread adoption of contactless cards and mobile wallets. Apple Pay, Google Wallet and Samsung Pay allow you to pay quickly and securely using your smartphone or smartwatch.

## Supported banks and cards

Most Norwegian banks and card issuers now support Apple Pay. This includes Bank Norwegian, Morrow Bank and many smaller savings banks. To use Apple Pay, add your card through the Wallet app and follow the on‑screen steps. Your card details are tokenised so merchants never see your actual card number.

## Benefits

* **Convenience:** Pay by holding your device near the terminal instead of swiping or inserting your card.
* **Security:** Transactions require Face ID, Touch ID or passcode authentication.
* **Integration:** Apple Pay works with public transport systems and many online merchants.

If your bank doesn’t support Apple Pay yet, you can still make contactless payments using the physical card’s NFC chip. Always check with your bank for the latest features and supported devices.
