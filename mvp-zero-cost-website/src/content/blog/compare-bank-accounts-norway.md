Choosing the right bank account helps you save on fees and earn interest on your deposits. Norwegian banks offer a variety of accounts with different fee structures, digital tools and benefits. This article compares common accounts and highlights what to consider.

## Types of accounts

* **Current account (brukskonto):** A day‑to‑day account used for salary deposits and payments. Usually offers no interest but includes a debit card and online banking.
* **High‑interest savings account (høyrentekonto):** Offers higher interest if you can limit withdrawals to a few times per year.
* **Joint account:** Shared between two or more people, useful for couples or roommates.

## Fees and features

Look out for monthly account fees, charges for paper statements, ATM withdrawal limits and fees for using cards abroad. Many banks now provide robust mobile apps with budgeting tools, spending insights and integration with digital wallets.

Research your options and choose an account that fits your lifestyle. Switching banks is easier than it used to be, so don’t hesitate to move if you find better terms elsewhere.
