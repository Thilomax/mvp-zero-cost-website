Many free credit cards in Norway let you choose between earning CashPoints (a form of loyalty currency used primarily with Norwegian Air Shuttle) or simple cashback. Each option has its pros and cons.

## CashPoints

CashPoints can be redeemed for flights and other products from Norwegian Air. If you travel frequently with the airline, this option can yield a higher effective return. For example, the Bank Norwegian Visa card provides **3–5 % points on Norwegian flights**【738997963336793†L139-L163】. Points can also be used for seat reservations, baggage fees or future upgrades.

However, CashPoints are tied to a single airline and subject to availability. If you rarely fly with Norwegian, you may struggle to use your points effectively.

## Cashback

Cashback is straightforward: you receive a percentage of your spending back as cash. The same card may offer **0.5 % on all purchases and higher percentages on specific categories**【738997963336793†L139-L163】. Cashback can be credited to your account or used to pay down your balance.

Unlike points, cashback has no restrictions – you can spend it anywhere. If you prefer flexibility or do not fly often, cashback is usually the better choice.

## Verdict

Choose CashPoints if you’re a loyal Norwegian flyer and want to maximise travel rewards. Opt for cashback if you value flexibility or use multiple airlines. Some cards allow you to switch between the two, giving you the best of both worlds.
