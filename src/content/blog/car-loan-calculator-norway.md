Purchasing a car often requires financing, whether new or used. Norwegian banks and credit institutions offer consumer loans with varying interest rates and terms. To help you evaluate your options, we’ve built a simple car loan calculator.

## Key parameters

* **Loan amount:** The price of the car minus your down payment.
* **Interest rate:** Fixed or variable, typically higher than mortgage rates because the loan is unsecured.
* **Term:** Most car loans span 3–7 years; longer terms lower the monthly payment but increase total interest.

Enter these values into our calculator to estimate monthly payments. Keep in mind that lenders may charge an establishment fee and require insurance coverage on the vehicle. Paying off your loan faster can save you money in interest.
