Your credit score (kredittscore) is a numerical indicator of your reliability as a borrower. Banks and credit card issuers use it to decide whether to approve your application and what interest rate to offer. In Norway, your score is based on factors such as income, outstanding debt and payment history. Follow these tips to improve your credit score over time.

## Pay bills on time

Consistently paying bills before the due date shows lenders that you are responsible. Set up automatic payments for your credit cards, utilities and phone bill. Even a single missed payment can negatively impact your score.

## Keep credit utilisation low

Try not to use more than 30 % of your available credit limit. High utilisation suggests that you rely heavily on credit and may struggle to repay it. If your limit is NOK 50 000, aim to keep your outstanding balance below NOK 15 000.

## Avoid excessive applications

Each time you apply for a loan or credit card, the lender performs a credit check. Too many checks in a short period can lower your score. Instead, research products carefully and only apply for those that suit your needs.

## Build a history

Length of credit history matters. Having a long‑standing account in good standing can boost your score. If you are new to Norway, consider opening a secured credit card or becoming an authorised user on a family member’s card while you build your own history.

Remember that improving your credit score takes time. With disciplined financial habits, you can gradually move into a higher tier and unlock better interest rates.
