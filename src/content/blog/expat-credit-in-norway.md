Moving to a new country can be exciting – and overwhelming. One of the practical challenges for expats in Norway is building a local credit history. Without a credit record, it can be harder to rent an apartment, get a loan or even sign up for a phone contract. Here’s how to get started.

## Register in the population register

First, obtain a Norwegian identity number (fødselsnummer) by registering with the National Registry. This number is required for most financial services.

## Open a bank account

Choose a bank that offers services in English. Bring your passport, residency permit and employment contract. Once your account is active, make regular deposits and payments to establish a track record.

## Apply for a small credit product

Start with a secured credit card or a low‑limit unsecured card. Pay your bills on time and keep your balance low to demonstrate reliability. Some banks may require proof of income or a Norwegian co‑signer.

## Monitor your score

In Norway, you can check your credit score for free once a year. Keeping track of your score helps you understand how lenders view your profile and what improvements you can make.
