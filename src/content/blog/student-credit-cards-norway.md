Students often need a credit card for online purchases, travel and building a credit history. In Norway, several banks offer cards tailored to young adults with no annual fee and favourable interest rates.

## What to look for

* **Low fees:** Choose a card without an annual fee and with low penalty charges.
* **Rewards:** Cashback or points on groceries, transportation or streaming services can add up.
* **Credit limit:** Start with a modest limit to encourage responsible usage.

## Recommended cards

1. **Student Visa from [Local Bank]** – No annual fee, 0.5 % cashback on groceries and 0.2 % on all other purchases. Includes travel insurance.
2. **Student Mastercard from [Another Bank]** – Earn points that can be redeemed for cinema tickets and public transport discounts. No foreign transaction fee up to NOK 20 000 per year.
3. **Prepaid Student Card** – Load money in advance and avoid interest altogether. A good option for those who want to avoid debt while still benefiting from card protections.

Remember to pay your balance in full each month and avoid overspending. Building good habits early lays the foundation for a strong credit score later on.
