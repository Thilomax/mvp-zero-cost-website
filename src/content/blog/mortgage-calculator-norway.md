Buying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll make. Understanding how monthly payments are calculated helps you plan your budget and determine how much house you can afford. Mortgage payments in Norway typically comprise principal repayment, interest and sometimes a service fee.

## How it works

The monthly payment depends on the loan amount, interest rate and term. Interest rates in Norway have fluctuated in recent years and vary by bank【403236159201442†L72-L79】. Use our calculator to experiment with different scenarios:

1. Enter the loan amount (e.g. NOK 3 000 000).
2. Select the annual interest rate (e.g. 4 %).
3. Choose the repayment period in years (e.g. 25 years).
4. The calculator will display your monthly payment and a repayment schedule.

**Tip:** Banks often require at least 15 % of the purchase price as equity. Factor this into your savings plan when estimating how much mortgage you can handle.
